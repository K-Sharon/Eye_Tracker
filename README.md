# Eye Tracker

The **Eye Tracker** project lets you control your computer cursor with your eyes for a hands-free experience. Use your right eye movement to control the cursor and perform click operations by blinking your left eye. This project combines Python, OpenCV, and Dlib for real-time eye tracking and blink detection. Clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the script to navigate your computer using just your eyes!# Eye_controller
